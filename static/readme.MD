# Static content for gh_pages

This group of static javascript/CSS/etc was autogenerated by the
github page generator using the 'Midnight' theme.

The default index.html file has been converted to a Jekyll layout and
made generic to accept a title and a github link (see _layout
directory on level above).  The layout file also has explicit
reference to this static location so any updates can be made to this
location and all gh_pages content (all kercheval depots) will
immediately start to use the new theme.
